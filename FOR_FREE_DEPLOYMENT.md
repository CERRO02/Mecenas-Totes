# Making Your Site Free to Deploy - Simple Changes Needed

Your current site has a backend server, which costs money to host. But we can make a few small changes to create a FREE version that shows off your artists and products beautifully!

## What We'll Do

Convert your dynamic site (with backend) into a static site (no backend needed) by:
1. Removing features that need a server (cart, checkout, login)
2. Using built-in data instead of API calls
3. Keeping all the beautiful design and artist showcases

## The Changes

I'll create modified versions of your files in a `static-version` folder. You can:
1. Deploy this static version for FREE right now
2. Keep your current dynamic version for when you're ready to sell (later)

## What Stays:
✅ All your artist profiles
✅ All your tote bag designs  
✅ Beautiful homepage
✅ Mobile responsive design
✅ Instagram links
✅ Contact information

## What Goes (Temporarily):
❌ Shopping cart
❌ Checkout
❌ User login/accounts
❌ Newsletter signup

## Why This Works

Instead of asking visitors to buy online (which requires payment processing, shipping, etc.), your site becomes a beautiful portfolio where people can:
- See your artists
- View the designs
- Contact you via Instagram or email to purchase
- Learn about your mission

This is actually PERFECT for right now because:
1. You're under 18 (can't process payments anyway)
2. It's completely FREE to host
3. You can still make sales through Instagram DM or email
4. When you're ready, you can upgrade to the full shopping version

## Ready to Deploy?

I can create the static version for you, or you can try deploying your current version to Vercel directly (they might auto-detect it needs a backend and handle it).
