# Mecenas Totes - Free Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Mecenas Totes website for **FREE** on Vercel or Netlify as a static portfolio/catalog site.

## What Changes

Since you can't deploy the backend for free on Replit, we'll create a **static version** that shows:
- ✅ All your beautiful artist profiles
- ✅ All your tote bag designs
- ✅ Contact information and social media links
- ✅ Beautiful portfolio presentation
- ❌ Shopping cart (requires backend)
- ❌ Checkout (requires backend)
- ❌ User accounts (requires backend)

This is perfect for showcasing your artists and products! When you're ready to sell, you can upgrade later.

## Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended - Easiest)

### Step 1: Create a Vercel Account
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up with your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account (it's free!)

### Step 2: Prepare Your Site
1. Download the files from the `static-deploy` folder (I'll create this for you)
2. Make sure you have all the image files

### Step 3: Deploy
1. Click "Add New Project" in Vercel
2. Import your code (you can drag and drop the folder or connect via Git)
3. Vercel will detect it's a Vite project automatically
4. Click "Deploy"
5. Done! You'll get a free `.vercel.app` URL

### Step 4: Custom Domain (Optional)
- Later, you can add a custom domain like `mecenastotes.com` for about $10-15/year

## Option 2: Deploy to Netlify

### Step 1: Create a Netlify Account
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up (it's free!)

### Step 2: Deploy
1. Drag and drop your `static-deploy` folder into Netlify
2. Or connect your GitHub repository
3. Netlify will build and deploy automatically
4. You'll get a free `.netlify.app` URL

## What I'm Creating For You

I'm preparing a `static-deploy` folder with:
1. All your current design and artists
2. Simplified pages that don't need a backend
3. All configuration files for easy deployment
4. Instructions specific to your project

## After Deployment

Once deployed, you can:
- Share your link on Instagram (@mecenas.totes)
- Show it to potential customers
- Build awareness for your artists
- When you're ready to add shopping (when you're 18 or have parent help), you can upgrade to a paid plan

## Cost Comparison

| Platform | Static Site | Dynamic Site (with cart/checkout) |
|----------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Vercel   | **FREE**   | ~$20/month                       |
| Netlify  | **FREE**   | ~$19/month                       |
| Replit   | Requires subscription | Requires subscription     |

For now, the free static site is perfect for showcasing your artists!
